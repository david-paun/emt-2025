./gradlew bootRun
./gradlew build --continuous

Suggestion to Proceed
I recommend the following implementation order:

✅ Add Guest and Review entities (they’re easier)

✅ Add Reservation

✅ Add RecommendationService with basic logic

✅ Add Availability model (e.g., start/end date slots)

✅ Extend Accommodation with price and country-based exchange logic

✅ Add ParkingSpot list or entity

Would you like to start with Review or Guest entity first? -> lets add all of these to the project now
